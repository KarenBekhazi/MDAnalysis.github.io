title: Introduction to Project, Community and Outreach Manager
---

Hello MDAnalysis Community! I am excited to join the MDAnalysis team and serve as the new Project, Community and Outreach manager. This role was made possible through a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative award as part of the [Essential Open Source Software for Science][] program: [“EOSS5: Growing the MDAnalysis community sustainably: A dedicated project manager, teaching and outreach initiatives”][eoss project link]. 

As a short introduction, my name is Jenna Swarthout Goddard, and I recently completed my Ph.D. in Environmental Health at Tufts University, MA, USA. My research focused on using computational biological approaches to identify environmental pathways for infectious disease transmission. I self-identify as an animal and food enthusiast and am an avid (which does not necessarily equate to skilled) golfer. 

I am looking forward to engaging with the MDAnalysis community and supporting MDAnalysis in expanding its outreach, mentorship and teaching efforts!
