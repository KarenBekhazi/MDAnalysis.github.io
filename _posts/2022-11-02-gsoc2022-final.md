This year MDAnalysis participated in two student programs with wonderful students from around the globe. 
We continued our participation in [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] for another year and also participated in [Outreachy][outreachy]! for the first time. 
Huge thanks to these organisations for supporting MDAnalysis and the students.

## Google Summer of Code
 
Our two outstanding GSoC contributors [Aya Mohamed Alaa][project-aya] (@aya9aladdin), and [Bjarne Feddersen][project-bjarne] (@BFedder) successfully completed their [GSOC projects][gsoc-projects].

You can read more about their projects and packages in their blog posts:
